Module 4, Activity 3
Group 2

For our second use case, the group's goal was to allow users to navigate from
park pass view to the itinerary view and account manager view where they can access 
their itinerary and view their list of attractions that they plan to visit. 
This progress was quite smooth since had some of the code down for Park Pass. 
However, we did face a few challenges while trying to populate the list of attractions,
since the controller had to initiate those changes into the view. That being said, 
we made good progress a group in terms of navigating from the account creation to park pass view 
from which the user views their itinerary,which they add onto as well as view the list of attractions. 
All in all we have collectively achieved both our intended use cases, which was initially to create an account 
and secondly to view and access their itinerary.

Our third use case was the full functionality of park pass. Although the two previous use cases revovled around the
Park Pass, it now functions how it was originally intended. The Park Pass is now a functions as a homescreen which a guest can use
to interact and view any of the previous two use cases. The Park Pass now shows the user's created itinerary, and properly display
any changes to the itinerary made by the guest through adding and removing attractions from it.


Our fourth use case is the incident reporting system. This use case invovled creating a seperate type of account
for employees. When an employee logs in with thier account, they are brought to the list of reports that are
created and viewable by other employees. These accounts are not created through the application interface for 
security reasons. Upon going to create a new report, an employee will click on the button on the IncidentReportView, this will
bring up the NewReportView. Using this view, the employee will choose between three different types of reports.
The employee then has a text field where they can describe the event for the other employees to read.
