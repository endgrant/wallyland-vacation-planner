Wallyland Vacation Planner
Module 3, Activity 5
Group 2


For our first use case, the group's goal was to sucessfully allow users of the 
application to open the app, and make an account. Orginally, our plan to get ahead
of schedule was to implement this and the functionality of what is named ParkPass.
The idea behind a park pass is to allow guest to purchase and place credits on 
their park pass which will serve as their entrance cost to any of the theme park
attraction. We however, did not anticipate the need for an account managment screen.
An account managment screen was nesscary to guide the user to screen after they 
have either logged in or created a new account. Although this puts us behind our
intended schedule,most of the logic for ParkPass has been written. We don't expect
to be behind given that we have got the chance to work out coding as a team will
should help us work faster in the future now that things like source control and
 naming conventions have been established.
