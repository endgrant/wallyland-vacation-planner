Wallyland Vacation Planner
Module 4, Activity 3
Group 2

For our second use case, the group's goal was to allow user's to navigate from
park pass view to the itinerary view and account manager view where they can add 
to the itinerary and view their list of attractions that they plan to visit. 
This progress was quite smooth since had some of the code down for Park Pass. 
However, we did face a few challenges while trying to populate the list of attractions,
since the controller had to initiate those changes into the view. That being said, 
we made good progressas a group in terms of navigating from the account creation to park pass view 
from which the user views their itinerary,which they add onto as well as view the list of attractions. 
All in all I think we have collectively achieved both our intended use cases, 
which was initially to create an account and secondly to view and add to the itinerary.
